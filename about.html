					<h1>North Lakhimpur College (Autonomous)</h1>
					<center><img src=images/img/91.jpg></center>
                        <p> The college strongly believes that its primary stake holders are students. It also understands the geographic, socio-demographic, economic and educational background of the people of this region. The college intends to provide quality education to all keeping in view the intelligence and economic status of the students.<p>
Whereas special remedial classes are organized for the academically poor students, the economically vulnerable but meritorious students are provided free admission and other in-house scholarships. North Lakhimpur College strictly adheres to the basic directives of U.G.C. for providing equal educational opportunities to differently-able persons. To boost the morale of the students, the institution itself offers various scholarships and awards to recognize meritorious achievements of the students in different fields apart from the scholarships received by the students from central and state government as per the government rules. The college also maintains a ‘Student Aid Fund’. A Career and Counseling Cell has been established for offering free career counseling to students and also for guiding the young minds to understand their strength by providing them with requisite know how of the emerging trends in different fields. The authority is leaving no stone unturned to guarantee that the College improvise the existing infrastructure so that it can keep pace with the global trends whether it be in the field of research work or to enhance the quality of the teaching-learning process. Congenial academic atmosphere in a pollution free campus, introduction of innovative, self financing and industrial courses, ICT enabled teaching - learning practices, adequate infrastructure, library and other resources, good hostel facilities for both boys’ and girls’, good teachers’ quality, transparent admission and enforcement of reservations, good results and progression are some of the key factors that attract students and stakeholders to North Lakhimpur College. A sound academic environment is the institution's goal which aptly complements its motto - "Let noble thoughts come from all directions"
